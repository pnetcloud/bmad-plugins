# LinkedIn Repurposer

## Purpose and selection

Turn something you already made into a post that reads like it was written for LinkedIn. Repurposing is not copy-paste. A tweet that flew on X will flop pasted into LinkedIn: too short, no whitespace, wrong rhythm, and a link in the body that tanks your reach.

This skill transforms, it does not generate. It reads your source, keeps the idea, and rebuilds the delivery for LinkedIn's 2026 algorithm.

### When to use

- "Turn this tweet / thread into a LinkedIn post"
- "Repurpose my YouTube video / blog / newsletter for LinkedIn"
- "This worked on Threads, adapt it for LinkedIn"
- "I have a rough idea in another format, make it native here"

Not for a blank-page draft (use `marketing-linkedin-post-writer`) and not for reviewing a finished LinkedIn draft (use `marketing-linkedin-humanizer --mode audit`).

## Working mode

Read [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) for conditional host/provider support before using any named library, CLI or connector. The original provider names and command examples below are not newly installed tools. Drafting from pasted input is supported without API credentials; stop the unavailable operation and offer its documented manual fallback. Before drafting, read [the shared contract](references/bundle-contract.md) and [precedence](references/bundle/precedence.md); choose the directly cited resources for the requested mode. Use one user-selected private Story Bank and Voice Profile across peer skills, not independently filled package templates.

### How it works

**Voice profile first (all drafts).** If `references/bundle/voice-profile.md` has `filled: yes`, load it and match the user's voice fingerprint, hard rules, and CTA/link style throughout. If it is not filled, mention once that `marketing-linkedin-humanizer --mode profile` can learn their voice from a few posts, then proceed with the generic voice rules. If `references/bundle/story-bank.md` has `filled: yes`, load it too and take concrete details (numbers, dates, named projects) from there instead of asking mid-draft. Never invent a figure that is not in it; if the bank has nothing that fits, ask the user or offer `marketing-linkedin-interviewer`.

1. **Take the source.** Any format: a tweet or thread, a video or script, a blog paragraph, a caption, a transcript, a bullet list, a link to read. Ask for the source and the goal (comments / reposts / likes / saves) if not given.
2. **Extract the spine.** Strip the source platform's shell and pull out the one claim, story, or number worth keeping. Repurposing fails when it keeps the words instead of the point.
3. **Re-hook for LinkedIn.** The hook must land in the first 210 characters, before the "...see more" fold. The source's hook rarely survives; write a new first line using one of the 20 formulas in `references/bundle/hook-formulas.md`, picked by the goal.
4. **Expand to LinkedIn length.** X compresses; LinkedIn breathes. Grow the spine into the 900 to 1300 char sweet spot: short paragraphs, double line breaks between ideas, one concrete detail per beat. A dense tweet becomes 4 to 6 short paragraphs, not a wall.
5. **Add the LinkedIn shape.** Whitespace between ideas, a moment of real stakes or vulnerability (pure-insight posts do not land in 2026), and one clear closing question or CTA.
6. **Fix links and artifacts.** Move any external link to the first comment (in-body links suppress reach). Strip off-platform artifacts: hashtag walls, "link in bio", "smash subscribe", X @-handles, "as I tweeted" throat-clearing. 0 to 2 hashtags at the end.
7. **Humanizer pass.** Run the scrub: 2026 AI vocab by density, em dashes above the cap (about one per 100 words), stacked rule-of-three triads, generic openers and reveal bridges. Keep the user's real numbers and named entities from the source.
8. **Approval card.** Show: source -> LinkedIn mapping (what became what), formula used, char count, suggested posting window (Tue/Wed/Thu 7:30 to 9:00 AM local), the link-in-first-comment note.
9. **On approval.** Publish via `lib.publish(kind="post", draft_text=<approved>, target_url="https://www.linkedin.com/post/new/", platforms=[{"platform":"linkedin","platformId":<id>}], scheduled_time=<iso_or_None>)`. The wrapper handles Publora / manual / diy routing. If the user reconsiders after approving, call `lib.unpublish(post_group_id=<postGroupId from the response>)` to cancel it before it goes out. On the publora tier the post is already queued, so the dashboard is otherwise the only way back.

## Focus

### Native-fit rules (source -> LinkedIn)

- **Tweet -> LinkedIn:** expand, do not paste. One tweet is a hook; grow the argument underneath it with whitespace.
- **X thread -> LinkedIn:** unroll into one flowing post, not a numbered list. Keep the best line as the hook.
- **YouTube video / script -> LinkedIn:** lead with the payoff, then the story of how you got there. Link the video in the first comment.
- **Blog / newsletter -> LinkedIn:** pick the single most quotable claim as the hook, then the one story that proves it. Do not summarize the whole piece.
- **Instagram / TikTok caption -> LinkedIn:** strip emoji density and hashtag blocks; add the professional stakes LinkedIn rewards.

### Resources

- `references/bundle/hook-formulas.md` - the 20 formula skeletons to re-hook with
- `references/bundle/algorithm-heuristics.md` - 2026 posting rules (timing, format, length)

### Related skills

- `marketing-linkedin-post-writer` - write a fresh post from scratch
- `marketing-linkedin-humanizer` - scrub AI tells, plus `--mode audit` to review the result
- `marketing-linkedin-hook-extractor` - reverse-engineer a hook from a post you admire

## Quality checks

Check the task-specific constraints, factual support, selected mode and the linked output specification before return. Keep missing inputs explicit; do not invent figures, profile sections, fetched records, detector scores or successful publishing. Treat upstream reach statistics and timing recommendations as source-attributed heuristics, not verified outcomes or guarantees. Preserve draft approval after edits; distinguish a requested action, an attempted call and read-back confirmation of the exact target.

## Return

Return the requested repurposer artifact, using its worked examples and selected mode. State material missing inputs, source limitations and any action not performed. Keep drafts distinct from approved or published content.

## Boundaries

This skill grants no installation, configuration, credential access, autonomous scheduling or publication authority. Publishing, reactions, reshares, DMs, profile edits, uploads and paid calls require the user's authorization for that exact operation and target; text-changing approval must be renewed after edits. Organizational review bypass or silent approval in the advocacy references is not permission for an agent to post. Verify authorized external writes by reading the exact target. Do not write filled Story Banks or Voice Profiles into distributable/tracked templates: obtain the user's chosen private storage path and approval first; preserve the same private context binding across all peers. Never send confidential drafts to detector providers; disclose the recipients and get consent before any permitted detector upload.

### Hard rules

Global voice rules: see `references/bundle-contract.md` §Voice rules. Additional skill-specific rules:

- Keep the source's **claim and facts** intact. Repurposing changes the delivery, never the meaning or the numbers.
- The hook must land in the first 210 characters, before the fold.
- Never paste the source and trim. Rebuild the hook, length, and rhythm from the spine.
- No external link in the post body. Offer to put it in the first comment.
- Include at least one moment of real stakes or vulnerability. Keep the source's real numbers and named entities.
- Do not name-drop the user's product as self-promo. One natural mention max.

### Anti-patterns (skill will refuse)

- Copy-pasting the source with light edits (that is not repurposing).
- Keeping the source platform's artifacts ("link in bio", "smash subscribe", hashtag walls).
- Shipping a tweet-length post with no whitespace or expansion.
- All-caps first line ("THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING").
- Em dashes above the cap (more than about one per 100 words), or an em dash swapped for a period.
- Rule-of-three lists without receipts.
- "leverage", "fundamentally", "game-changer", "deep dive".
- External links in the body.
- Meta throat-clearing ("I originally posted this on...").
